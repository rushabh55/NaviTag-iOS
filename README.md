# TreasureHunt-iOS
Thought of an App that can turn places into puzzles? This application allows you to solve hints and decode images of places around you. Visit the place and checkin, and you win the hunt! You can also leave behind an image and a hint of places for your friends to solve. The target audience for this application are teenagers and above. We successfully implemented and used CoreLocation API, CoreImage API, JSON translation of data, and backend services written in PHP with MySQL database. We also experimented with SpriteKit and iOS Foundation Framework.

This is our swift repo for the Treasure Hunt game on iOS.
